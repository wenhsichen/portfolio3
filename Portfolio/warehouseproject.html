                    <p>10 target users were recruited to test our redesigned version of the app. Half of the usability testing was conducted remotely because users were located in different warehouses across the State.</p>
                    <p class="small-title">Usability Tasks</p>
                    <p>Users were provided with a scenario related to their daily job and asked to utilize the real examples from their calendar to test the effectiveness of the new warehouse calendar in completing those tasks. The researcher observed users' behavior and conducted interviews, including follow-up questions, to understand their actions and gather feedback throughout the process.</p>

                        <li class="bulletpoint">Overall, users are satisfied with the new version of the warehouse calendar, which provides them with more useful features to facilitate their work.</li>
                        <li class="bulletpoint">The new color-coded system, indicating the job status, has been incredibly helpful for users in assigning installers and quickly reviewing all their jobs to identify any uncompleted tasks that require follow-up.</li>
                        <li class="bulletpoint">The new features provides users with a quicker way to assign installers, which is very helpful for users and saves them a significant amounts of time in their daily jobs.</li>

                    <p>After using the new warehouse management application for a couple of weeks, users are still not quite familiar with all its functions. They are still accustomed to performing their tasks in the old way. Therefore, it would be beneficial to provide users with documentation that explains how to utilize the application's features in various scenarios. Additionally, this documentation would be valuable for onboarding training purposes.</p>

                    <p>From this project, I discovered that having a standard process was very important for companies, especially since our company has multiple locations across the States. Those warehouses were previously third-party warehouses, each with its own process, leading to diverse requests for functions and need in the warehouse management system. However, standardized processes were vital for maintaining employee productivity and facilitating future onboarding. As a result, in this project, I started by interviewing all the warehouses about their experience and engaging in discussions with stakeholders to establish the processes and then designed the detail of the system.</p>
